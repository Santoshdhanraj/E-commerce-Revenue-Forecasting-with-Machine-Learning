This project builds a revenue forecasting model using simulated historical sales data and visualizes actual vs. predicted revenue.

---

# Objective
Forecast monthly revenue based on historical trends using machine learning, and communicate insights through visual reports.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook
